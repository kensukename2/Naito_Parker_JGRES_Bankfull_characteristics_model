# Numerical model on banfkfull discharge and channel geometry

Numerical model that describes spatiotemporal evolution of bankfull characteristics of an alluvial meandering river


## Model description

Here, two numerical models that are presented in tow research papers submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research in December 2018. 
The models describe spatiotemporal co-evolution of bankfull characteristics (i.e. bankfull dishcarge, bankfull width, bankfull depth and down-channel slope) are provided. 

### Part 1: Base run


### Part 2: Alteration of flow duration curve
