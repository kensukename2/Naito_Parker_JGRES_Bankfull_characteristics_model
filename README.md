# Numerical model on banfkfull discharge and channel geometry

Numerical model that describes long-term spatiotemporal evolution of bankfull characteristics of an alluvial meandering river


## Model description

Here, two numerical models that are presented in two research papers submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research in December 2018. 
The models describe reach-characteristics spatiotemporal co-evolution of bankfull characteristics (i.e. bankfull dishcarge, bankfull width, bankfull depth and down-channel slope) are provided herein. 


#### Part 1: Base run

Here, the model and its products as well as its input flow duration curve are provided. 
The model is implemented for the case of Trinity River near Romayor, TX, USA to demonstrate fundamental behavior of the model. 


#### Part 2: Alteration of flow duration curve

Here the model and its products as well as its input flow duration curves are provided. 
The model is implemented for the case of Minnesota River near Jordan, MN, USA to demonstrate the potential application of the model. 
It is designed to examine the effect of the alteration in the flow duration curve on the bankfull channel characteristics. 
Since the analysis focuses on rapid channel cross-section (width and depth) deformation, longitudinal channel slope is specified and fixed.
